A visual coding platform reflecting your social media images.

## Dev

First, set the required environment variables: `INSTAGRAM_CLIENT_ID` and `INSTAGRAM_CLIENT_SECRET`, and make sure you have an Instagram app with matching settings (specifically you need to whitelist the oAuth callback URL). You might also want to set Meteor's `ROOT_URL`.

When that's set simply run:

```bash
$ meteor
```

Or any of the other Meteor commands.
